DONE: Need to finish enough UI interaction that cards can be placed on the board.

Might need a refactor of "playspace" "playstate" "move" "movecard"
-- those names aren't really satisfying me right now. There's confusion between move/movecard and playspace just sucks as a thing at all.

playspace.constructHtml needs some lovin for validating 
the move and whether it can be applied there.
-- should decide where that validation should lie. 
?move? class? -- there's already logic in 'playstate'. 
Some of that can be turned into a validator.
